# WeatherApp - STEH

WeatherApp is a modern web application that provides users with accurate and up-to-date weather information.

The application allows users to quickly and easily get detailed forecasts, including temperature, humidity, pressure, and other relevant meteorological data, as well as a 5-day forecast.

In addition to weather forecasts, the application includes a page with the latest news from the world of meteorology, allowing users to stay informed about the latest events and research. Each news item has its own detailed page where users can read more about selected topics.

Users also have the option to personalize the appearance of the application by choosing between light and dark themes, providing a better user experience.

The [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API was used to create this application.
