# A month’s worth of rain in one day

Multiple communities across South Florida — including the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas — flooded Wednesday amid bouts of torrential rain that prompted the state’s governor to declare an emergency and stranded drivers across the region.

**Flood warnings** are in effect Wednesday night for parts of Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier and Hendry counties through Thursday morning, according to the National Weather Service, which warned “life-threatening flooding” was ongoing. Flood watches were also extended for Miami and Fort Lauderdale until Friday evening.

“Many areas are inundated with water w/ stalled cars & more rainfall is on the way,” the weather service said Wednesday night. “Stay off the roadways if possible.”

Footage on social media showed water levels in the area reaching to vehicles’ windows and filing up parking decks and neighborhood streets.

In Miami, video showed stranded cars that were nearly entirely submerged under water. It’s the second consecutive day the Miami area has faced down flooding issues. Storms dropped **2 to 5 inches of rain** and flooded streets Tuesday.

In Hallandale Beach, where footage showed one man kayaking among cars as high waters flooded parts of the city, officials urged residents to shelter in place and avoid driving or walking through the water.

Hallandale Beach officials said a family lost their son during the storm, but were later reunited with the help of local police who were able to find the young boy.

A woman who was driving to work said she spent five hours stuck in her car along Hallandale Beach Boulevard and US Route 1 because of the flooding.

Along with the **heavy rainfall**, the storm system also brought an EF1 tornado Wednesday to Hobe Sound, located in Martin County about 35 miles north of West Palm Beach, a National Weather Service damage survey confirmed.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared an emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade, and Sarasota counties, writing the heavy rain and floods has affected the “operational capability of critical infrastructure,” including major interstates, roadways, schools and airports.
