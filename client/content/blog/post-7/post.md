# Unwieldy wildfires

Improving winds and a storm moving into western Canada are providing a temporary boost to **firefighters battling massive wildfires**, but the danger remains heightened as they burn close to three communities.

Drought-starved vegetation and days of gusty winds have fueled more than 100 wildfires tearing across Canada that have choked the air with smoke and forced thousands to evacuate since the weekend.

But weather conditions took a turn midweek and are providing some help for firefighters working to gain the upper hand on the flames.

Winds have died down in some areas and shifted in others, pushing flames away from Alberta’s Fort McMurray, a city still haunted by a catastrophic 2016 fire dubbed **“The Beast”**.

A large, slow-moving storm will also track through western and central Canada from midweek into the weekend. Cooler air from the storm will flow across fire-torn provinces while relative humidity levels rise and chances for rain increase.

While the assist from Mother Nature will not last indefinitely, any potential containment is welcome news for the thousands of people whose homes and businesses are at risk.

Roads out of Fort McMurray were crammed with evacuating cars Tuesday as an out-of-control 51,000-acre wildfire crept toward the city’s edge. The approaching flames conjured up **terrifying memories** for residents who lived through the 2016 fires, which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses.

Evacuation orders were issued for the city’s neighborhoods of Prairie Creek, Beacon Hill, Abasand and Grayling Terrace on Tuesday. The rest of the city and several surrounding suburbs are on alert to evacuate at a moment’s notice.

Roughly 6,600 people in Alberta had evacuated as of Wednesday, local officials said during a Wednesday news conference. Residents can expect to be away from their homes until at least May 21, the regional municipality said in a news release.

A veil of thick smoke made it difficult for firefighters to see as they battled “extreme fire behavior,” Tuesday Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said. Safety concerns have prompted some firefighters to be removed from the front lines.
