# Facts

The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30. The areas covered include the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.

The National Weather Service defines a hurricane as a “tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher.”

Hurricanes are rated according to intensity of sustained winds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. **The 1-5 scale** estimates potential property damage.

A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane.

The National Hurricane Center advises preparedness:

• A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions **within 48 hours**.

• A hurricane warning indicates that sustained winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours.

# Predictions

May 4, 2024 - The Colorado State University Tropical Meteorology Project team predicts an “extremely active” Atlantic hurricane season. The team forecasts 23 named storms, including 11 hurricanes, five of which will be major hurricanes.

May 20, 2024 - The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasts an 85% chance for an above-normal season, predicting that there is a 70% chance of having 17 to 25 named storms, of which eight to 13 could develop into hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes (Categories 3-5).
