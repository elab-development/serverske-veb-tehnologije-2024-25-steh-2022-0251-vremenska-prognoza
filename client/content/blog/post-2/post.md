# Heavy rain falling on still-flooded South Florida

**Heavy rainfall** has been inundating South Florida for a third day in a row on Thursday, with flash flood warnings in effect from Miami to Fort Lauderdale, after Wednesday’s storms transformed roads into canals and caused water to seep into homes.

Flash flooding is likely to occur at a faster rate than usual as the areas around Miami are already saturated from more than a foot of rain in the past two days.

Nearly 1.7 million people living in South Florida – including the cities of Hialeah, Aventura and Doral – are under a flash flood warning Thursday evening as a line of storms approach the Miami area and bring the potential to produce **several inches of rain** in a short period of time, according to the Miami-South Florida office of the National Weather Service.

“Significant flash flooding (is) expected over urban areas, (with) locally catastrophic flash flooding possible,” the Weather Prediction Center warned earlier Thursday.

High risk days are exceedingly rare — happening on fewer than 4% of days each year on average — but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the US.

More than **8 million people are under flood alerts** Thursday, including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Naples. Another 4 to 8 inches of widespread rain is expected through Friday, but it’s possible some spots record nearly a foot of rain.

Six to more than 20 inches of rain has deluged South Florida since Tuesday morning, prompting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties. While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution.
