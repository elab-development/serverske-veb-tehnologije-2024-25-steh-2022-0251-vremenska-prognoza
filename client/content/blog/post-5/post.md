# Weather-related power outages are getting worse

Picture this: It’s a Thursday night in Houston and thunderstorms are rolling in. Suddenly, **winds roar past 100 mph**. Trees snap, windows shatter and the city darkens as power flickers out.oss the region.

Even after it’s over, it takes days for the lights to come back on in parts of the city.

A week and a half later, the Tuesday morning commute is just getting underway in Dallas. Thunderstorms rush through the city, unleashing hurricane-strength wind gusts and torrential rain. Trees and power lines topple to the ground, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. Many homes and businesses remain without power days later.

That’s exactly the scenario that played out in Texas over the past few weeks, and these kinds of outages are happening more frequently as destructive extreme weather thrashes the aging electric grid.

From 2000 to 2023, 80% of all major US power outages were due to weather, according to analysis by Climate Central, a non-profit research group. The number of weather-related outages **from 2014 to 2023** doubled compared to outages at the start of the century.

Being without power is not only expensive – keeping people out of work and school, and keeping businesses closed – it’s dangerous. There doesn’t need to be a heat wave in Texas for summertime temperatures to soar to unhealthy levels. Heat is particularly dangerous without A/C at night, which is when the body needs to cool itself after a hot day.

Experts say there could be ways to keep the lights on in the face of extreme conditions, even if there’s no single perfect solution.

Power generation, transmission and distribution within the US happens on a power grid, an interconnected series of power plants, power lines and electrical substations. But the grid’s infrastructure is aging fast and struggling to keep up with modern power demands, according to the US Department of Energy.

It’s also struggling as extreme **weather gets more intense as the planet warms**.

“Our (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,” Michael Webber, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas said. “It wasn’t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.”

A majority of the US electric grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but some of the first parts of the system were constructed in the early 1900s. And 70% of transmission lines in the US are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifecycles, according to the DOE.

Power is largely distributed by above-ground power lines from large transmission towers to smaller – and abundant – power poles. Most outages happen because of failures with power lines and poles, making them a “big weakness” in the overall system, according to Webber.
