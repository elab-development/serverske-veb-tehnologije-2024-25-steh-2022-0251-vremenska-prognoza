# Warming climate is worsening wildfire behavior

**Dangerous wildfires** have scorched tens of thousands of acres and are closing in on multiple Canadian towns, forcing thousands of evacuations and degrading air quality.

The country’s wildfire season is off to a troubling pace as new fires ignite each day and dormant so-called “zombie” fires reanimate. The 2024 fire season isn’t yet on par with last year’s record-shattering season but with wildfire behavior worsening in a warming world it’s no wonder Canadian fire officials are warning of an “explosive” season that may rival last year.

Extremely dry and windy conditions have caused multiple fires to grow thousands of acres since the weekend. Despite wet weather on the horizon, firefighting will remain a challenge in several provinces through midweek due to gusty winds.

Gusty winds caused the Parker Lake Fire in northeastern British Columbia to surge in size from **13,000 acres Monday to nearly 21,000 acres** Tuesday. The blaze was just over a mile west of the town of Fort Nelson early Tuesday morning.

At least 4,700 people are under evacuation orders, including in Fort Nelson and Fort Nelson First Nation, Bowinn Ma, British Columbia’s minister of emergency management and climate readiness, confirmed Monday.

Large wildfires have also prompted evacuation orders in Manitoba province and alerts in Alberta province. Evacuation alerts mean people should be ready to evacuate in case an evacuation order is issued.

Manitoba is home to one of the largest active wildfires in the country, which had charred more than 86,000 acres as of Monday. More than 500 residents in the community of Cranberry Portage – less than a mile away from the fire – were evacuated as of Monday, according to Manitoba officials.

A large fire about 10 miles southwest of Fort McMurray, in northeast Alberta – an area that was devastated by a wildfire in 2016 – had consumed over 23,000 acres as of Tuesday after growing significantly overnight. An evacuation alert was issued for residents in Fort McMurray, Saprae Creek, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray 468 First Nation and Anzac, according to Alberta officials.

Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said Tuesday the wildfire **“is still out of control”** and it “grew significantly to the northeast yesterday and continues to grow in that direction today,” adding the wind was pushing the blaze toward the town of Fort McMurray.

With difficult weather and fire conditions, firefighters were pulled from the fire line, St-Onge said, but crews were working to battle the flames with aerial support.

An evacuation order was also issued Tuesday by the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, with officials telling residents in Abasand, Beacon Hill, Prairie Creek and Grayling Terrace to prepare to evacuate by 4 p.m. local time.

“Our main priority is the protection of life and property.” Jody Butz, Regional Fire Chief and Director of Emergency Management, said in a news release. “It’s important to note that fire activity is very different than the 2016 Horse River wildfire and we are well positioned to respond to this situation.”
